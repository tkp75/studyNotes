'''
In this challenge, you must implement the factorial() function. It takes an integer as a parameter and calculates its factorial.

The factorial of a number, n, is its product with all the integers between 0 and n.
factorial(n) = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*1
The factorial for 0 and 1 is always 1.


The input will always be an integer, so you donâ€™t need to worry about that. If the integer is negative, the function always returns -1.

Sample Input #
n = 5

Sample Output #
120

def factorial(n):
	if n < 0:
    return -1
	if n <= 1:
		return 1
	return n*factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))
